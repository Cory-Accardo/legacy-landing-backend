The Shop Love program involved many small black owned businesses throughout L.A who needed a transformed online presence to improve sales.

To resolve this, the Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation (VSEDC) derived an idea for a single web application to manage the marketing, SEO, and online listings of various products from these businsses. 

The issue however, was seamlessly routing the money and invoices to all of these businsses so that they could fulfill the orders immediately.

Leveraging my expertise of Stripe and its various APIs, I created this elegant backend solution that utilizes the full suite of Stripe's enormous functionality to provide safe, PCI compliant, infrastructure for shoplove.com.

Note to developers: Email administrators to request .env secret key (otherwise decryption will fail)
